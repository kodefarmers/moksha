                had conducted a rapid assessment of open spaces, identified and mapped 83 open spaces in Kathmandu valley in 2013. These open spaces were later proven to be very useful during Nepal Earthquake 2015. Realizing the importance of open spaces identification, International Organization for Migration (IOM) planned to identify and map open spaces in five other
                locations; earthquake-affected municipalities outside the Kathmandu valley.
